    <h1>Policies</h1>
    <h2>1. Respect each other please</h2>
    <p>Just master the following good manners:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>be tidy and clean</li>
        <li>if it’s not yours, don’t take it</li>
        <li>don’t be round naked as you were alone</li>
        <li>don’t turn the lights unnecessary on the dorms</li>
        <li>don’t smash the doors</li>
        <li>do not use other dorm mates space (or things!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Your padlock – your key to safety</h2>
    <p>Your padlock will be your major treasure.</p>
    <p>Many modern hostels also have super cool bunk beds with their own lockers inside your little capsule, so to say.</p>
    <p>We always travel with two, small padlocks.</p>

    <h2>3. Wanna cook?</h2>
    <p>Don’t be that person who uses all the kitchen pots and spaces and leave them just there to do the dishes later.</p>
    <p>Use the pots you need and clean them directly. Leave everything tidy.</p>

    <h2>4. Silent mode (at least at Night)</h2>
    <p>This actually goes without saying, but it seems like people need a reminder sometimes. Silent mode is a good idea! And
    not just for your cell phone.</p>
    <p>Common areas are meant to hang out, meet people, or have telephone conversations.</p>
    <p>Use them and do not disturb your dorm mates.</p>
    <p>Many hostels have the common area completely separated from the rooms.</p>

    <h2>5. A note for Early and Late birds</h2>
    <p>If you arrive at the hostel very late/ early, just prepare all the stuff you will need out of the dorm.</p>
    <p>Like that, you won’t disturb your dorm mates.</p>
    <p>There’s nothing more irritating that the unpacking noise of plastic bags while you are sleeping (or trying to get asleep).</p>
    
    <h2>6. Don’t use the dorm as a porn set</h2>
    <p>Dorms are not the place to have sex…your dorm mates WILL hear you, definitely! Seriously, you know it, we know it, everybody knows it!</p>
    <p>You can always adapt to the situation.</p>

    <h2>7. The bathroom is not your SPA</h2>
    <p>The bathroom is a common area, not a personal spa. I know it is difficult sometimes…bathrooms can be so beautiful!</p>
    <p>Take into consideration that there are some other travelers which may also need it.</p>
    <p>We are not saying you should not enjoy your shower. Just use common sense and don’t block the bathroom for the next 3 hours</p>

    <h2>8. Regard hostel vibes, rules, and ambience</h2>
    <p>Hostels have written rules which must be respected.</p>
    <p>Also, If the ambience is very chilly, don’t pretend to party.</p>
    <p>Here are the hostel vibes from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow the rules</li>
        <li>Laugh a lot and make friends</li>
        <li>Return the key to the reception when you leave (also your locker key)</li>
        <li>Please: Clean up after yourself</li>
        <li>No food or drink in the bedrooms please</li>
        <li>we are not responsible for loss or damage of your stuff</li>
        <li>It is not allowed to use drug in or around the hostel</li>
        <li>For unjustified use of fire extinguisher, we charge at least a fine of Kshs. 500</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
